Starting with the input, a simple scan through identifies that the program can be split into 14 repeatable blocks.
At the start of each block the variables `x` and `y` are reset to 0, only the variable `z` carries over between blocks.

Each block of the program is of one of two types:

Type A:

```
inp w
x = z % 26
x += {A}
if (x !== w) {
  z = z * 26
  z += w + {B}
}
```

For blocks of type A, `{A}` is always positive and greater or equal to 10. Since `x = z % 26` means that `x` will fall in the range of 0-26, and `w` is always a value 1-9, it follows that `x !== w` always evaluates to false.
These blocks can be thought as adding the digit `w + {B}` to a base-26 number `z` or alternatively pushing a value onto a stack.

Type B:

```
inp w
x = z % 26
z = z / 26
x += {A}
if (x !== w) {
  z = z * 26
  z += w + {B}
}
```

For blocks of type B, `{A}` is always zero or negative. These blocks can be thought of as removing a digit from `z`, or popping from the stack. If the condition `x === w` is met, then no further values will be pushed back onto the stack.
As there are in total 7 push operations, and 7 pop operations, it is essential to avoid pushing more values onto the stack to ensure `z = 0` at the end of execution.

Translating the input instructions into stack operations we get the following:

```
PUSH W[0] + 0
PUSH W[1] + 3
PUSH W[2] + 8
POP - 5 = W[3]
PUSH W[4] + 13
PUSH W[5] + 9
PUSH W[6] + 6
POP - 14 = W[7]
POP - 8 = W[8]
PUSH W[9] + 2
POP = W[10]
POP - 5 = W[11]
POP - 9 = W[12]
POP - 1 = W[13]
```

Solve the stack to find equations:

```
W[2] + 3 = W[3]
W[6] - 8 = W[7]
W[5] + 1 = W[8]
W[9] + 2 = W[10]
W[4] + 8 = W[11]
W[1] - 6 = W[12]
W[0] - 1 = W[13]
```

Solving for the largest MONAD number:

```
W[0]  = 9
W[1]  = 9
W[2]  = 6
W[3]  = 9
W[4]  = 1
W[5]  = 8
W[6]  = 9
W[7]  = 1
W[8]  = 9
W[9]  = 7
W[10] = 9
W[11] = 9
W[12] = 3
W[13] = 8

W = 99691891979938
```

Solving for the smallest MONAD number:

```
W[0]  = 2
W[1]  = 7
W[2]  = 1
W[3]  = 4
W[4]  = 1
W[5]  = 1
W[6]  = 9
W[7]  = 1
W[8]  = 2
W[9]  = 1
W[10] = 3
W[11] = 9
W[12] = 1
W[13] = 1

W = 27141191213911
```
